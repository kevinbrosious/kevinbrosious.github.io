    <h1> Information about Me! <h1>
        <h3> <p> I am a young man who uses most of his time interacting with others about my interests. <br>
                 I love to explore, learn and see things from other peoples point of views. Seeing things <br> 
                 from other peoples perspective is a key skill to gain. You begin to value other people <br>
                 more and learn their backgrounds. I created this page to share my love for the game and <br>
                 Kobe Bryant, who is my idol since the day I can remember. He showed us all what Mamba <br> 
                 Mentality is. It is up to you to discover it. Thank you for visiting.
